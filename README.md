## Hi there 👋
I'm Shelvin Batista. I've obtained a degree in Systems Engineering, Information Systems Technology and Professional Technician in Software Programming.  I have worked as a backend developer, frontend developer or fullstack developer. I have 9 years of experience as a software developer in different programming languages. In all experiences, I have worked with relational 
and non-relational databases.

## 🚀 About me
Personally, I consider myself an analytical and open-minded person to new ideas. I analyze in detail the tasks to be developed, with the aim of proposing improvements, which allow me to optimize the solution.
